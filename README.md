This is a part of our full stack team project that uses TypeScript, TypeORM, Koa and a PostgreSQL database for back end. 
The website offers a weekly calendar for healthy meal plans that is randomly taken from the database. Ingredients are calculated based on the number of households. Users can choose or change a displayed meal plan and add it 
to their shopping list, which can be printed out. 

The frontend repo can be found here:  https://github.com/sabeenski/final-project-meal-planner-client
